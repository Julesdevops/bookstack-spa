## Native SPA
- Goals : writing a small SPA with minimal dependencies and no framework
This is an experimentation for:
- HTML data-* attributes
- history API
- Fetch API
- Web components
- Web crypto api
- Accessibility
- ...

## todo
- snackbar, for showing feedback to users (for instance 'the book has been sucessfully deleted')
- correct book pages access and display
- test the provided API URL to check if the API is responding, if not, feedback the user and allow him to correct his input
